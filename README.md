GUI Explanation:
Both doctors and patients can sign up. 
The patient can search for doctors based on speciality and receive a list of doctors along with their ratings. After choosing a suitable doctor, their page would display their office location along with their schedule availability in the form of a calendar for the patient to book and receive a pop up confirming the booking.
The doctors will get a page with their current appointments, in which he can click to add a prescription for the patient where he would specify the timings for the patient to take their medication, which would alert the patient at the specified time. The doctor would receive a popup confirming the prescription was fulfilled succesfully.
